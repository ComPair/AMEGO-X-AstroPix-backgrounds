# AMEGO-X-AstroPix-backgrounds
.tra files for AMEGO-X background simulations

1 hour of space simulations, AMEGO-X configuration with AstroPix tracker (250 Î¼m pixel size).

Note: The (prompt) **trapped hadronic** and **trapped leptonic** background files are retained here only for historical reasons. These two components contribute mainly during the SAA passage when the detector is expected to be off, and thus **do not contribute to the overall background rates**. They are simulated because they do contribute to the **activation** background. They have been removed from the summary file `TotalBackground.tra.gz`.
